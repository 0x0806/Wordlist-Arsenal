- **Password Brute Force**: Comprehensive password attack wordlists
- **Default Credentials**: Extensive database of manufacturer defaults
- **Username Generation**: Pattern-based username variations
- **Custom Patterns**: Rule-based wordlist generation
- **Hybrid Combiner**: Advanced wordlist mutation and combination
- **API Endpoints**: REST, GraphQL, SOAP, and webhook discovery
- **Web Technology Paths**: Framework-specific directory structures
- **Security Testing**: Vulnerability assessment payloads

### Advanced Capabilities
- Real-time wordlist preview and statistics
- Drag-and-drop file upload analyzer
- Generation history with local persistence
- Advanced filtering and deduplication
- Multiple export formats (TXT, JSON, CSV)
- Comprehensive mutation algorithms
- Pattern-based generation with placeholders
- Responsive design for all device types

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Language**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling**: Advanced CSS with custom properties
- **UI Framework**: Native CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Compatibility**: Modern browsers with ES6+ support

### Performance
- Client-side processing for enhanced privacy
- Efficient memory management for large datasets
- Progressive loading for improved responsiveness
- Local storage for session persistence

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Web server for hosting (development or production)

### Local Development
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Serve the files using any web server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
3. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`

### Production Deployment
The application can be deployed on any static hosting service:
- Upload all files to your web server
- Ensure proper MIME types for CSS and JS files
- Configure HTTPS for production environments

## Usage

### Quick Start
1. Select a generator from the main navigation tabs
2. Configure generation parameters using the control panels
3. Click the generate button to create your wordlist
4. Use the results panel to copy, download, or save to history

### Generator Configuration
Each generator provides specific configuration options:
- **Checkboxes**: Enable/disable specific wordlist categories
- **Text inputs**: Custom additions and extensions
- **Range controls**: Length and iteration parameters
- **Dropdown menus**: Output format selection

### Pattern Generation
Use the following placeholders in custom patterns:
- `@l` - Random lowercase letter
- `@u` - Random uppercase letter
- `@d` - Random digit
- `@s` - Random special character
- `@w` - Word from custom wordlist

### File Analysis
Upload existing wordlists for comprehensive analysis:
- Word count and uniqueness metrics
- File size calculations
- Average word length statistics
- Automatic format detection

## Security Considerations
